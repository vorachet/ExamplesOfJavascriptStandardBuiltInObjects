Questions/Answers
=================

A) Why did you pick your particular your design?
   What assumptions did you make,and what tradeoffs did you consider?

    I think of practical scenario for the users.
    I assume that the program user is a marketer in company.
    So I proposed a small program named "analyzer"

    The analyzer can help marketers to get the following information

            All Orders by companyName
            All Orders by customerAddress
            Count Ordered Items

    Marketers may need to know how to export CSV based data from system.
    Since they have a snapshot of data (sample.txt), they can start simple analytics with the analyzer

    There is not thing special in my design and the problem can be solved by
    the very basic javascript functions map(), filter(), and reduce()

    I show you how I made a small program to satisfy your exam.
    With more than working solution, we can make an executable program easily from NodeJS platfrom
    as I demonstrated the analyzer.

B) What do you like (and dislike) about Node/Javascript compared to other programming languages?

Thanks NodeJS project. It allows us to develop a program or more complex software using javascript.

Nowadays, many server-side system tasks can be done with NodeJS.

Using javascript with web front-end becomes a basic thing for very front-end developer

NodeJs is good as it is. It may not good for big number processing.

Machine learning and NLP is comming, I see that NodeJS is not good compared to Python and Java.



Thank you for ginving a change to take the exam.

Look forward from you about good news and challanges at your company
